# Get-SkypeUserDiscoveryData

Get-SkypeUserDiscoveryData will read a CSV input file containing a list of userPrincipalNames (UPN) and perform the following functions:

	1. Check that the user object exists in Active Directory using userPrincipalName from the CSV input file as the Identifier.
		a. Verify that the following addresses all match:  userPrincipalName, MsRtcSip-PrimaryUserAddress, Primary SMTP (from proxy addresses) and SIP (from proxy addresses)
		b. Check each address listed in item a. for any invalid characters: 
			List of Invalid Characters: \ % & * + / = ?  { } | < > ( ) ; : , [ ] â€œ ' ` ^ $ = ! # ~
		c. Optionally: Check for the existence of an Exchange Online Hybrid routing address, i.e. user@tenant.mail.onmicrosoft.com
		d. Optionally: Check for the existence of any mail domains that should be flagged as erroneous.
	2. Check that the user object exists in Lync/Skype, using userPrincipalName from the CSV file as the Identifier.
	3. Get attributes of the user object from both AD and Lync/Skype and output that as a PowerShell object.
		a. The output object will contain a field named "ErrorFlags."  This field will contain a pipe "|" delimited string of values containing all errors that were encountered during processing the userPrincipalName.  The field will be blank if no errors were found.

The CSV file specified as the -FilePath parameter MUST contain a column named userPrincipalName.  Other columns can exist in the CSV and will be ignored.  For most use cases, you will probably want to use a command similar to the below to generate a report file in CSV format.

Example: Get-SkypeUserDiscoveryData.ps1 -FilePath CsvInputFile.csv | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation -FilePath SkypeUserDiscoveryData.csv
